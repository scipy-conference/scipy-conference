Notes From the SciPy 2018 Post-Con Lunch
========================================

Notes from the post-con lunch at the end of SciPy 2018. Notes taken by
Alexandre Chabot-Leclerc.

Grab bag
--------

- Have an "unconference room" + hallway track.
- What about an official mentoring or pair programming room/session? Office
  hours? For people new to Python, or who just need some help. Maybe ask for
  experienced members of the community to volunteer a few hours during the week
  to "staff" the help room. It's some kind of Help Desk++.


Sprints
-------

- Good to have an actual organization
- Master spreadsheet was good because it forced sprint leaders to fill out
  certain details
- They should be better advertised. Do more work with Communications
- Don't like the word "sprints" (also echoed during the SciPy 2019 BOF). Need
  a more inclusive name.
- What about a sprint for newcomers to get started? Maybe to work on their own
  stuff with experienced members of the community. See also the idea of
  a mentoring program discussed below under Activities.
- Sprint financial aid didn't work well. Not really needed this year. Maybe
  keep it as an option?


Tutorials
---------

- The bar for acceptance is very high. Some proposals are much more fleshed out
  than others. How to make it inclusive and "easy" to get started, without
  requiring all the materials up front?
- Tutorials mentorships for more varied applicants?
- Git reviews?
- Add link to good past submissions in the submission form.
- Explicitly prompt for timing information in submission form.
- Reach out to more events (with comms), e.g. PyLadies, Meetups, etc.
- Not enough reviews. Co-chairs reviewed all 55 submissions. Each reviewers did
  5-6 reviews.
- Prompting for submissions from past attendees and from particular
  organizations/projects/languages worked great.
- Too many attendees. The rooms were really crowed. How to control? Check
  badges? Silly hats? Colored lanyards?
- Could we live stream popular tutorials into another room?


Program Committee
-----------------

- Repeat of tutorials: The bar for acceptance is very high. Some proposals are
  much more fleshed out than others. How to make it inclusive and "easy" to get
  started, without requiring all the materials up front?
- More submissions than last year.
- Stickers + prodding works to get reviews done on time
- Reduce the number of tracks (see alternating years idea below)
- Pains with EasyChair (but with ETouches too)
- We received "token submissions" (very weak) from VIPs. We should manage
  expectations. The submissions should good from everyone. There could be some
  guidance in the prompt.
- Similarly for reviews; they should have some substance.
- The general track turned out to be less popular than other tracks
- What about tagging talks instead of tracks?
- What about having single-talk tracks? It basically guarantees a track under
  a given name if there's a least one talk.
- Some tracks would need more slots so that there's a critical mass of content
  for people who would normally not come to SciPy (e.g. some geoscience
  people). Pair with tutorials for that particular track? Maybe alternate years
  for certain tracks so there's more space for them? Alternate between US and
  EU? The downside is that we might attract more people from a given field, but
  not from new fields.
- What about entirely open process (public), e.g., Github? Not just double
  open? There are concerns for GDPR.


"Movement" & Logistics
----------------------

- Rooms were far from each other, which negatively affected the "hallway
  track". Could we use the 100 floor?
- The poster sessions conflicts with the job fair. Turn the poster session into
  more of an event? Drinks? Even more posters?


Proceedings
-----------

- 4 people is good
- Build server is great
- Starting early was good
- Not enough reviewers, some people didn't do their reviews
- Could abstract reviewers also be paper reviewers? Probably a big ask.
- At prestigious computer conferences, there's a technical committee who takes
  care of all the reviews. They're invited. It's a prestigious position. Maybe
  try something similar? Put the members' names on the website? There's
  a concern that it may affect the path from contributor to be involved in the
  proceedings committee. Maybe give different titles to people on the
  committee? Editors, Committee Chairs, etc.
- Get more people involved in the development [of the toolchain?].


Financial Aid
-------------

- Eric hand-built a submission reviewing system (he doesn't recommend doing
  that)
- The expanded submission form was very valuable, but it was also more
  intimidating. It seems like a zero-sum game: too many boxes lead to fewer
  applicants.
- Focus on financial aid as a way of brining in new people (?) in addition to
  bringing in members of the community who would otherwise not be able to
  attend.
- How to get more money?
- How to manage financial aid for speakers? Should they get it automatically or
  not? Should the funds be separate? Timing with the talk acceptance is also
  tricky.


Activities
----------

- 80 people signed up for Broken Spoke, 55 on bus + others with other means of
  transportation
- General organization started too late
- Vislab was super popular
- More planning of some mentoring program. Ideas were: early career mentoring,
  new-to-python mentoring, and new-to-SciPy mentoring.
- Clarify with committee members about the implications of being on the
  activities committee (tasks, deadlines, number of people, etc.)


Sponsors
--------

- Send sponsorship packages earlier in the year because of the timing with
  which some companies set their budgets.
- Offer doing interview with possible candidates during SciPy to gold sponsors


Diversity
---------

- Meetups were good
- BoFs were great
- Do more, earlier communications
- Good discussions happened on Slack and during talks
- Some people didn't actually help even thought they said they would. How to
  get more dedicated committee members?
- Offer diversity scholarships?
- Schedule diversity BoFs in large room after big talk, so they have more
  exposure, and more would likely attend.


Communications
--------------

- Reach out to more underrepresented communities
- The spreadsheet was really useful
- Do more thorough follow up


About the physical program
--------------------------

- Don't use two different sections about financial aid. Maybe differentiate
  them with footnotes?
