<p>subject: SciPy 2024 Call for Proposals</p>
<p>Dear {{Name}},</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://cfp.scipy.org/2024/cfp">SciPy 2024</a> call for proposals is open and I am emailing on behalf of the Tutorial Committee to encourage a submission from you.
I know you've given very successful tutorials before and we'd love it if you submitted a similar contribution this year.
Tutorials will be presented July 89 and the conference is in Tacoma, WA.

You may find additional information <a href="https://www.scipy2024.scipy.org/">here</a> and the deadline for submission is February 27.</p>
<p>Please feel free to email with any questions.</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>
Logan Thomas<br>
SciPy 2024 Tutorial Co-chairs</p>
