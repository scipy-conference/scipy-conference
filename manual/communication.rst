To contact all organizers, email to scipy-organizers [AT] scipy [DOT]
org.

Internally the tasks management is done using an instance of Redmine
hosted by Enthought for now. It goal is to allow management of all future Scipy
conferences. The project is called scipy-conf.
The current managers of the redmine instance include jrocher
[AT] enthought.com, bmurphy [AT] enthought.com, mtranby [AT]
enthought.com, and andy.terrel [AT] gmail.com. 


Outreach
======

To inform the outside world about the conference, 
* a Scipy conference twitter account has been created: 
username: SciPyConf
pass: rha-chuf 
and andy.terrel [AT] gmail.com is the owner. 

* a google+ page ScipyConference has been created and can be reused
every year:
https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/100948873231627513165/
The current owner of the page is jonathanrocher [AT] gmail.com. Others are
currently managers: bmurphy [AT] enthought.com, mtranby [AT]
enthought.com, and andy.terrel [AT] gmail.com.

* a mailing list with all participants will be created: ?? scipy2013
  [AT] scipy [DOT] org ??

* To increase diversity at the conference, there are women coder
  groups that we want to make sure to contact including PyLadies,
  LadyCoders and CodeChix.


Advertizing
===========

Online websites that people read are best places to advertize for the conference:
* Slashdot
* Hacker News (don't think they do ads)
* Reddit.com (r/programming or r/python)
* Stacked Overflow (especially http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/ )
* Ars Technica
* Wired
* NA-digest (http://www.netlib.org/na-digest-html/)

You might also try to do organize join-advertizing with other related
conferences:
* PyCon (in all its state and international flavors)
* PyData
* OSCON
* SuperComputing

Not very many developers read journals or magazines, though
occasionaly people follow:
* Communications of the ACM
* SIAM News (http://www.siam.org/news/)
