SciPy John Hunter Excellence in Plotting Contest
================================================

In memory of John Hunter, we are pleased to announce the Third Annual
SciPy John Hunter Excellence in Plotting Competition.  This open
competition aims to highlight the importance of quality plotting to
scientific progress and showcase the capabilities of the current
generation of plotting software.  Participants are invited to submit
scientific plots to be judged by a panel.  The winning entries will be
announced and displayed at the conference.

John Hunterâ€™s family is graciously sponsoring cash prizes for the
contest winners in the following amounts:

* 1st prize: $1000
* 2nd prize: $750
* 3rd prize: $500

Instructions
------------

* Entries must be submitted by April 13, 2015 via e-mail to
  plotting-contest@scipy.org

* Plots may be produced with any combination of Python-based
  tools. (It is not required that they use matplotlib, for example.)

* Source code for the plot must be provided, in the form of Python
  code and/or IPython notebook, along with a rendering of the plot in
  PDF format.  If the original data can not be shared for reasons of
  size or licensing, "fake" data may be substituted, along with an
  image of the plot using real data.

* Each entry must include a 300-500 word abstract describing the plot
  and its scientific importance for a general scientific audience.

* Entries will be judged on their clarity, innovation and aesthetics,
  but most importantly for their effectiveness in illuminating real
  scientific work.  Entrants are encouraged to submit plots that were
  used during the course of research, rather than merely being
  hypothetical.

* SciPy reserves the right to display any and all entries, whether
  prize-winning or not, at the conference, use in any materials or on
  its website, with attribution to the original author(s).

Important dates:
----------------

* April 13, 2015: Plotting submissions due

* Winners will be announced during the SciPy conference days.

We look forward to exciting submissions that push the boundaries of
plotting.
