SciPy 2014 Diversity Funding Announcement
=========================================

The thirteenth annual Scientific Python conference, SciPy 2014, will 
be held in July in Austin, TX. The SciPy community knows that the 
more people who are involved in scientific problem-solving, the 
better off we all will be because the diversity of perspectives leads
to a diversity of solutions. Therefore, in an effort to increase the 
diversity, as well as the pool of people who are able to attend the 
conference, there are now an additional 5 funding opportunities 
available, thanks to generous support from NumFOCUS. To apply for this 
funding, supply the information indicated on the financial aid 
application site ([finaid]_).

We also encourage those interested in Diversity in Scientific 
Computing (DISC) to consider registering for the DISC luncheon. 
Registration for the lunch will be available during registration 
for the conference.
