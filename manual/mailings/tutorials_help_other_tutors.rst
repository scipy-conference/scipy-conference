Tutorials Help Other Tutors
===========================

Dear Tutor,

As we already informed you, we have already got a pretty good number of registrations for the conference, and we will probably reach a new record on people attending tutorials than any other SciPy conference before.  That means that several tutorials will run at full room capacities (50 places for introductory and 90 for the rest).  Of course, the organization is going to do an extra effort in order to help you dealing with the details for handling a large number of attendees on every classroom in the best possible way.

However, and in order to improve the experience of attendees, we think that it is a good idea that you can help each other on the different tutorials also.  Your collaboration would be more important when it is time to solve exercises and people get stuck at something and want to catch the attention of someone more knowledgeable that can help them solving things like conceptual or compilation issues or just not getting the correct output for exercises.

In order to allow other tutors helping you better, it is very important that they are aware of the exercises that you are going to propose, *as well as* the solutions for them.  Our proposal is that you should have the materials for your tutorial ready at least *1 week* before the conference, so that you can exchange them among you using this very same mailing list.

The idea is that you could have a quick glance at each other materials, and propose yourself to help on the tutorials you feel like they can contribute better.  Again, use this mailing list to ask/offer help.  There will presumably be many crossing messages, but this is fine as long it serves the purpose.  Contact us (tutorial chairs) in case of doubt.

Please, help yourselves to make SciPy 2013 the best conference ever!
