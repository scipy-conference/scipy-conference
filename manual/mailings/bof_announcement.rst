SciPy 2017 Birds of a Feather Sessions (BoFs) - Call for Submissions
====================================================================

SciPy has plenty of opportunities to get together and discuss primary,
tangential, or unrelated topics in an interactive, discussion setting.

In an effort to increase the opportunities for community building, SciPy
emphasizes birds of a feather (BoFs) sessions. These sessions usually include
short presentations by a panel and a moderator with the bulk of the time spent
opening up the discussion to everyone in attendance. BoF topics can be of
general interest, such as state-of-the-project BoFs, or based on the themes of
the conference and the mini-symposia topics.

Some examples from the past BoFs include Reproducibility, Jupyter Notebooks,
Distributed Computing, Geospatial Packages in Python, Teaching Scientific
Computing with Python, Python and Finance, NumFOCUS, Python in Astronomy,
Collaborating and Contributing in Open Science, and a Matplotlib Enhancement
Proposal Discussion.

We would like to solicit the community for ideas and organizers for BoF
topics. Please include a small description of the BoF, possible panelists, and
whether you would be willing to moderate.

To suggest a Birds-of-a-Feather session, fill out a brief description in the
webpage (Google Form): https://scipy2017.scipy.org/ehome/220975/493427 Please
submit your topic before June 27, 2017. We are looking forward to your
submission!
