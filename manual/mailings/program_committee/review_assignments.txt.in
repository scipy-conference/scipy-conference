Dear {{ name }},

Thank you for agreeing to be part of the Program Committee this year. We are 
excited that the conference has received 133 abstract submissions, a record 
number!

Based in part on your expertise, we request that you review the following 
abstracts by April 21.

To view the above links, it is necessary to create an account on the website 
[0] and to apply to be on the program committee team [1].

Once you gain access to the links above, you should see the abstract submissions 
that we would like you to review. 

We know this is a friendly and tightly knit community. If there are any 
abstracts for which you cannot provide an unbiased review, please let us know 
and we will reassign that abstract to another reviewer. With that in mind, you 
are also welcome to review any other abstracts in addition to those that we have 
requested above. To browse all reviews, navigate to your review dashboard. Note 
that you will not be able to see the reviews of any abstract for which you are 
the author.

Please note that each review will require two parts. One part will take place in 
the website interface and the other part will take in a longer google form. If 
you have any questions about or issues with the process, please don't hesitate 
to let us know. 

Once again, thank you for you important work in contributing to the excellence 
of the SciPy 2014 technical program!


Warmly,
Katy Huff and Serge Rey
