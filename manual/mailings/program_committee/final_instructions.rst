Dear confirmed SciPy talk or poster presenter, 

SciPy 2013 is nearly upon us! 

---------------------------- 
Have you registered?

All speakers and poster presenters need to register 
(https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013/registration.php). We are a community 
conference and can't waive these fees as they are essential to keeping the 
conference at the high quality it is. Those of you whom have not yet registered 
may receive a reminder email soon.

Once you've registered, you'll be able to suggest BoFs
http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013/bofs.php and Sprints

participating!

----------------------------------
When are you presenting?
---------------------------------- 

Poster presenters will be presenting during the poster session, 10:35 AM -
11:35 AM on June 27th. Your poster will remain on display through the entirety
of the conference. Please check the online program to ensure that your poster
is confirmed https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013/posters.php .

Speakers will find their scheduled talk at
https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013/conference_talks_schedule.php . 

--------------------------- 
What is the format ?  
---------------------------

Poster presenters should be aware that the poster stands are made up of 2
upright poles, 2 horizontal bars and 2 bases (no wheels.) These will
accommodate posters 36 or 42 inches tall and up to 72 inches wide.  Posters
that are taller can hang below the bottom horizontal bar. The stands will have
a foam core board in case someone needs to pin something to the background.
Large metal clips will be provided to fasten posters to the metal bars if
needed, but please bring your own thumbtacks or pins to fasten items to the
foam core boards.

Talks in the general, machine learning, and tools for reproducibility tracks
are scheduled for 30 minutes each. Please plan your talk to allow time for
questions and transitions during those 30 minutes. 

Talks within the minisymposia may be of different lengths, specific to each
mini-symposium. If your talk is part of a mini-symposium and you would like
more information, please contact the chair for further details about the format
of those symposia. Their contact information is :
