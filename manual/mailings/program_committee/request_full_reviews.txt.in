Dear {{ reviewer }}, 

As the proceedings co-chairs for the 2015 Python for Scientific Computing
Conference (http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2015), it is our honor to invite
you to review the full paper submissions that we have received. You and the
program committee are among a group of experts whom we have selected to bring
specialized knowledge to the paper review process.  Your expertise in
scientific computing with python is of particular interest this year.

Due to the extraordinary efforts of the Program Committee and the authors
themselves, there are 31 proceedings submissions to review, which is twice as
many than we received last year! Since many hands make light work, we would be
grateful for your expertise and will list you as a member of the review
committee in the published proceedings. You are encouraged to review any of the
submissions that seem interesting to you, and based on your expertise, we would
like to recommend the following titles:

{% for title in assigned_papers %}
  {{ title }}
{% endfor %}

You can find the latest PDFs of the papers at:

If a paper is outdated, just click on its sync button. Review comments can be
made directly on the pull request (the paper title links to the PR).

Reviewers are asked to work with the authors (i.e. comment, wait for update
from author, comment) until the paper is ready for inclusion in the
proceedings.  This decision should be based on the technical expertise of the
reviewer as well as the guidance found here:
https://github.com/scipy-conference/scipy_proceedings/blob/master/review_criteria.md.
When you deem it ready for inclusion, you can simply add a comment along the
lines of "@katyhuff @jaberg The paper is ready to be merged.".

We would like to ask that you please complete your communications with the
author by June 30th. We know this is a tight turn around, but are striving this
year to have the proceedings available during the conference - we hope you can
help!

Please don't hesitate to contact us with any questions.

Warmly,
Katy Huff and James Bergstra
