Dear {{ name }},

Thank you for agreeing to be part of the Program Committee this year. This is a 
friendly reminder that reviews are due tomorrow. We also wanted to clarify some 
instructions on the review site that might not be clear. Each review requires 
two parts. For each abstract, please leave comments for the author in the 
website interface and leave your full review for Serge and I in the longer 
google form [0].  Thank you for your efforts to complete these reviews on 
time!

If you have any questions about or issues with the process, please don't 
hesitate to let us know. Note that we are aware that there is a bug in the 
website review submission form that occasionally causes an Internal Server Error 
[1].  If you have this issue, please don't worry. Simply submit it with a +0 
entry. We will be extracting your overall recommendation for each review from 
the google form instead. Sorry about the failure there. The web team is trying 
to figure out how to fix this in preparation for next year. 

See the previous email on this topic for your assigned reviews and instructions.

Once again, thank you for you important work in contributing to the excellence 
of the SciPy 2014 technical program!

Warmly,
Katy Huff and Serge Rey
