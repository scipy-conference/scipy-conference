Dear {{ name }},

Thank you for being a member of the SciPy2014 Program Committee! With your expert reviews, we have generated an excellent technical program. The schedule of talks is nearly finalized and can be found online [https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/schedule/]. A list of accepted posters will also be online soon.

Now, we still need your help to review full papers for the proceedings.  If you are willing to help us review full papers, please volunteer by email no later than May 22. To review SciPy2014 papers, email Stefan van der Walt <stefan@sun.ac.za> for instructions. To review full papers from SciPy2012, email Aron Ahmadia <aron@ahmadia.net>.

More Details:

In previous years, full paper submissions were reviewed by volunteers from the program committee and published in conference proceedings [https://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/].  We believe that both the involvement of a panel of experts and the publication of written papers raises the quality of the conference and thus helps attract new users and developers to the scientific Python world. We would be grateful for your participation in reviewing full papers for 2014. If you participate, you will be given special recognition as a member of the 2014 program committee and acknowledged in the published proceedings. This will be a commitment of a few hours over the next month.

Also, we would love your help reviewing 2012 papers. Stefan van der Walt and Aron Ahmadia are resurrecting the reviewing process for the SciPy 2012 openly published proceedings, which was unfortunately not completed, leaving the manuscripts from that year in limbo.  If you would like to participate, we will ask that you commit to review at least two of the submitted 2012 manuscripts by mid-June. If you participate, you will be given special recognition as a member of the 2012 program committee and acknowledged in the published proceedings.

Again, thank you so much for your participation in this process. The excellence of SciPy is truly a reflection of the generous community of brilliant scientists behind it. We hope to see you there!

Thank You,
Katy, Serge, Aron, Stefan, and all of the SciPy 2014 Organizers
