Request for Full Reviews
========================


Thank you for being on the Program Committee this year! As a result of your
efforts, a full program for the conference is now available on the website and
we have received a number of full papers to be published in the proceedings.

There are only 15 papers, but many hands make light work. If you think you can
manage to review at least one paper please fill in your name next to it as soon
as possible on this google doc: 

<doc>

Then, once you've volunteered to review some papers, go to :
https://stefan.pythonanywhere.com .

There, you can find the latest PDF of the paper to review (if it is outdated,
just click on "Build latest").  Comments on the review can be made directly on
the pull request (the paper title links to the PR).

Reviewers should work with the authors (i.e. comment, wait for update from
author, comment) until the paper is ready for inclusion in the proceedings.
When the reviewer(s) deem it ready for inclusion, they can simply add a comment
along the lines of "@stefanv The paper is ready to be merged.".

The deadline for inclusion is June 14th, so please complete your communications
with the author by then.
