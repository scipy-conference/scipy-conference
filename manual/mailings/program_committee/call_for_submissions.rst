SciPy 2014 Call for Submissions
-------------------------------

SciPy 2014, the thirteenth annual Scientific Computing with Python conference,
will be held this June 8th-10th in Austin, Texas. Associated tutorials and
sprints will extend the conference to July 6th-12th. SciPy is a community
dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python
software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference
allows participants from academic, commercial, and governmental organizations to
showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and
collaborate on code development.

The deadline for abstract submissions is *March 14th, 2014*.  Submissions are
welcome that address general scientific computing with Python, or one of the two
special themes for this year's conference, or the domain-specific mini-symposia
held during the conference.  Examples talks from previous years are available
online[1].

Themes
------

Two specialized tracks run in parallel in general conference:

- Scientific Computing Education
- Geospatial Data in Science

Mini-symposia on the following topics are also being organized:

- Astronomy and astrophysics
- Bioinformatics
- Geophysics
- Vision, Visualization, and Imaging
- Computational Social Science and Digital Humanities
- Engineering

Abstract submission
-------------------

The 150-300 word abstract should concisely describe software of interest to the
SciPy community, tools or techniques for more effective computing, or how
scientific Python was applied to solve a research problem.  A traditional
background/motivation, methods, results, and conclusion structure is encouraged
but not required.  Links to project websites, source code repositories, figures,
full papers, and evidence of public speaking ability are encouraged.

Each abstract will be peer-reviewed by multiple members of the Program Committee
Board.  Please submit your abstract at the SciPy 2014 website[2] (submission
form forthcoming).  Abstracts will be accepted for posters or presentations.
Optional papers to be published in the conference proceedings will be requested
following abstract submission.  A draft version of the proceedings will be
available during the conference to help attendees navigate talks.

We look forward to an exciting and interesting set of talks, posters, and
discussions and hope to see you at the conference.
