Hello {{ potential_chair }},

I am {{ program_chair1 }}. {{ program_chair2 }} and I are the Program Committee
Co-Chairs for the 2013 International Scientific Computing with Python (SciPy)
Conference (June in Austin, Texas) [0] [1]. I am emailing to ask you to be the
chair of an {{ Domain }} SciPy "mini-symposium." 

You were recommended by some of your colleagues as an excellent representative
of the Python-in-{{ Domain }} community.

Mini-symposia at SciPy are intended to allow some focused domains to discuss
issues that may not pertain to the general SciPy audience. A recent poll
conducted by the SciPy team indicated that {{ domain }} was a highly desired
topic among potential attendees. Thus, we have decided on 4 symposia, of which
{{ domain }} is one. 

This is where you come in. We need a dynamic, community-involved symposium chair
to be in charge of selecting 4-6 papers from all of the submissions from
{{ domain }}. As the symposium chair, you will direct the format and
content of the 1.5 hour session. In the past, the symposia have featured a
historical summary of Python's presence in the field and a guided discussion of
challenges and future direction. The session will take place during one evening
of the conference in parallel with another domain symposium.

This is about how it will work: 

After we put out the call for proposals in a week, we will all solicit submissions
from our various communities.  Your extra effort to solicit abstracts from your 
community will ensure the symposia will be a great success.

As we receive the abstracts, we will divvy them up to your program committee,
making sure there are at least two reviewers for each 150 word abstract. We'll
share the "{{ domain }}" ones with you for your perusal.  You can choose to
review those papers or just select your favorites post-review. 

This year, the main general track topics will be Tools For Reproducibility and
Machine Learning.  

We hope you are interested and look forward to hearing from you soon! Please let
us know if you have any questions at all.


Sincerely,
{{ program_chair1 }} & {{ program_chair2 }}
