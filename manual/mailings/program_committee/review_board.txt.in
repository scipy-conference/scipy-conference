Dear {{ board_member }},

We are pleased to invite you to be on the program committee for the
2013 Python for Scientific Computing Conference [0].
(http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013).  The conference will be held
June 24 - June 29 in Austin, TX.

For the 12th consecutive year, the conference will bring together the
developers and users of the open source software stack for scientific
computing with Python.  Attendees have the opportunity to review the
available tools and how they apply to specific problems.  By providing
a forum for developers to share their Python expertise with the wider
commercial, academic, and research communities, this conference
fosters collaboration and facilitates the sharing of software
components, techniques, and a vision for high level language use in
scientific computing.

For the last four years, abstracts for proposed talks were reviewed
by a program committee and accepted talks were published in a
conference proceedings [1].  While the conference is not a traditional
scientific conference with a rigid review and publication system,
we believe that both the involvement of a panel of experts and the
publication of written papers raises the quality of the conference
and thus helps attract new users and developers to the scientific
Python world.

This year, we would like to solicit your help in selecting suitable
talks for the conference. The associated workload is fairly light;
last year, each review board member reviewed approximately nine 150
word abstracts, which amounts to approximately a 2-3 hour time
commitment.

This year we have two specialized tracks: "Machine Learning" and "Tools for
Reproducible Science", and four domain specific mini-symposia: "Medical
Imaging", "Meteorology, Climatology, and Atmospheric and Oceanic Science",
"Astronomy, Astrophysics", and "Bioinformatics".  Contributors may select to
contribute to a specialized track or to the general session, but all submissions
will go through the program committee for review.

We have selected a variety of different experts whom we believe will
bring different points of view to the selection process.  We would be
pleased to have you as a member of the committee.  Please let us know
whether you can accept by Sunday, April 7th and which topics you find
particularly interesting.


Best regards,

Matthew McCormick, Program Committee Co-Chair
Katy Huff, Program Committee Co-Chair
