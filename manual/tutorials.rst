Decision Points
===============

  * Are we doing tutorials shorter/longer than 4 hours. Last year's
    call says from 2 hours to 2 days. Should we just say 4hrs which
    has been the recent practice.

    - Keep Tutorials to 4 hours.

  * Open/Assigned Seating - Should tutorials have assigned
    seating. Adv: Stops certain rooms from being overcrowded
    (i.e. IPython last year). Disadv: More of a registration/logistics
    hassle since you would have to keep track and enforce who was
    signed up for what

    - Assigned seating prefered, need to discuss this with rest of
      organizing committee since it effects registration.

  * Introductory Tutorials - Invited? Fixed Topics? Open Topics?

    - Invite proposals on fixed topics, if not enough submissions then
      invite specific speakers
 

Tracks
======

Introductory Track 
------------------

This is one of the most important in terms of bringing new people into
the Scipy community. In 2011, very few tutorial submissions fell into
this category. We will need to encourage submissions and/or invite
people to teach these topics. We may want to specify four 1/2 topics
and invite proposals for those specific topics.

Suggested 1/2 day topics in order:

* Introduction Scientific Python Basics (Numpy and IPython)
* Introduction to plotting with Matplotlib
* Introduction to Scipy: optimization, linear algebra, statistics, and
  more
* Introduction the data analysis with pandas

Intermediate Track
------------------

Prerequisite should be basic understanding of Scipy stack, i.e. numpy,
scipy, matplotlib etc.

Advanced
--------

Under the hood or advanced concepts. 


Other Notes
===========

Need to write up more detailed instructions for the actual
event. Points to remember:

  * Have folks submit test scripts that check whether you have all the
    packages required.
  * Encourage folks not to use development versions, have versions
    finalized before conference starts. This cause lots of issues last
    year.
  * No helping audience install stuff during tutorial. This caused
    lots of delays in some tutorials last year. Maybe have a
    pre-tutorial install time?
