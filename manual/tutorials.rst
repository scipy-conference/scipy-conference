Tutorials
==========

Here there are some important points for organizing the tutorials for
the SciPy conference.  They are based on the experience of previous
conferences so please, for the sake of keeping future organizers
happier, you are encouraged update this document in the parts that are
necessary.


Decision points
===============

  * Last year (2013), 3 different tracks (introductory, intermediate
    and advanced) were scheduled, and we decided to have 4 slots of 4
    hours each per track.  See the details in
    `mailings/tutorials_announcement.rst`

    - A decision needs to be made for this year, but last year
      experience was pretty good.

  * Open/Assigned Seating - Should tutorials have assigned
    seating. Adv: Stops certain rooms from being overcrowded
    (i.e. IPython last year). Disadv: More of a registration/logistics
    hassle since you would have to keep track and enforce who was
    signed up for what

    - In 2013 the tutorials had assigned seating right on the
      subscription web page, and attendees generally did respect that.
      With the conference growing, our advise is that continuing doing
      that is kind of critical.

  * Introductory Tutorials - Invited? Fixed Topics? Open Topics?

    - Invite proposals for specific instructors on fixed topics prior
      to the submissions.  Last year invited many tutors, and finally
      we were not be able to give a tutorial to each one, but in the
      end this allowed us to choose better, so I think this is worth
      the effort.
 

Tracks and call for proposals
=============================

It is a pre-condition to have the tracks nailed down before the call
for submissions announcement.  In 2013, 3 different tracks
(introductory, intermediate and advanced) were scheduled, and we
decided to have 4 slots of 4 hours each per track.  See the details in
`mailings/tutorials_announcement.rst`


Introductory Track
------------------

This is one of the most important in terms of bringing new people into
the Scipy community. In 2013, we had to pull the attention of
instructors for most of the tutorial submissions in this category.  We
will need to encourage submissions and/or invite people to teach these
topics. We may want to specify four 1/2 topics and invite proposals
for those specific topics.

Suggested 1/2 day topics in order:

* Introduction Scientific Python Basics (Numpy and IPython)
* Introduction to plotting with Matplotlib
* Software carpentry: git/GitHub, unit testing
* Introduction to data analysis with pandas

Intermediate Track
------------------

Prerequisite should be basic understanding of Scipy stack, i.e. numpy,
scipy, matplotlib etc.

Advanced
--------

Under the hood or advanced concepts. 


Preselection
============

* After the last deadline, the tutorial co-chairs should carefully
  study the proposals and, depending on the requirements and 'hot
  topics' for the conference, select the candidates that are best
  suited.  For the selection it is important that you do some research
  about the quality of the tutors as teachers, as this is a critical
  parameter for increasing the quality of the tutorial tracks.

* Take notes about the submissions, because these are going to be
  important, specially for providing feedback in non-acceptance mails.
  In 2013 we almost had a 3:1 submission ratio, so better be ready for
  justifying the rejections.  This year we did not provided this, and
  some submitters got very disappointed.

* For doing the preselection, it is important to get in touch with the
  general conference co-chairs, as they have a broader vision of the
  conference, and also past conferences, so they can provide a very nice
  insight on many different aspects of the selection.

* Once the preselection is complete, send a mail to the selected
  tutors and ask for confirmation.  Be patient and wait until
  everybody confirmed.  In 2013 we had a case that took several days
  to confirm.  In this case it helps sending a last call and requiring
  him to confirm in less than 24 hours (this probably helps people
  waiting for company management approval).  He confirmed on-time.

* *Important*: Once the list of tutorials is confirmed and *prior* to
   making it public, *please please please*, send a non-acceptance
   message for non-selected submitters.  In 2013 some folks got angry
   because they found their submissions were not accepted by reading
   the list of accepted tutorials in the official website.  This
   should not happen again.

* *After* the messages for rejection are sent, the list can be made
  public.  Do the proper announcements for this.

* It is important that chairs would not hurry up too much in this stage,
  because the selection is one of the most critical parts of the
  process.  Take your time for this, and our experience is that 2-3
  weeks for tackling the complete selections process would be fine.


Pre-tutorials tasks
===================

* Two months before the conference, send a welcome message to tutors
  with a reminder to define the software requirements as well as
  scripts and exercises ready by two weeks before the tutorials start.
  The reason of having the exercises already defined is to allow
  tutors help each other during the actual tutorials.  You can find an
  example of the welcome message in
  `mailings/tutorials_welcome_tutors.txt`.

* Also, one month before the conference send, and in a separate
  message, send the results of the tutorial surveys for the previous
  year.  They should contain important information for them to prepare
  their material (and for themselves as instructors).

* In 2013 we encouraged tutors to help each other during the
  tutorials.  This turn out to work great, specially on the
  introductory ones, where people tends to have more problems because
  they are not familiar with the environment.  You can find the
  message sent 1 month before the tutorials in
  `mailings/tutorials_help_other_tutors.txt`.

* 2 weeks before the tutorials, create a mailing list for all tutors
  (in 2013 it was tutors2013@scipy.org) as well as different mailing
  list for each tutorial.  The general tutorial mailing list will be
  useful not only as a communication channel between organizers and
  tutors but also between them too (for helping each other, for
  example).  The specific mailing lists per each tutorial will serve
  for tutors to communicate with their pupils, and for organizers to
  send the results of the surveys (see below).

* During the 2 week before, send a couple of messages to the tutors
  reminding that they *must* send their instructions to attendees for
  following there tutorials.  It is critical to ensure that tutors do
  not send that information the night before, for example (and despite
  all our efforts this actually happened in 2013).

* Just in case, maybe programming a pre-tutorial install session will
  be a nice safeguard for people not doing a good job reading messages
  from tutors.  But the goal is that nobody would actually need to
  attend to this session (we achieved this in 2013).


Post-tutorial tasks
===================

* Immediately after the tutorials are finished, a survey must be sent
  to the attendees for assessing the performance of the different
  tutors.  You can find the survey for 2013 here:

  http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1291753/SciPy-2013-Testing-Individual-Tutorial-Experience-Feedback

  I don't know if that will survive for next years, so at the end of
  the document there is a text version of it.

  IMPORTANT: There can be tutors attending as pupils to other
  tutorials, so it is *not* enough to send the survey to attendees,
  but you should send it also to *all* tutors too.

* When the results would be ready, send them in a sensible format
  (e.g. text or PDF; never, ever, send a MS Word or other proprietary
  format) to the tutors list.  The results might be useful for next
  year tutors, so please store them in a sensible and *private* place.
  The reason for keeping the results private is that this is somewhat
  sensible info and some tutors may not be happy to see the survey
  results publicly available in a general way.

* After sending the results of the survey, take your time to comment
  the results with tutors on the mailing list and finally send another
  message congratulating all of them for all the effort done.

* And last but not least, take your time to update this manual so that
  other tutorial chairs would find clear instructions for the next
  awesome SciPy conference.


Enjoy organizing the tutorials for the next conference!
