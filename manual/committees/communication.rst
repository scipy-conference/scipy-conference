HOWTO Communications
=====================
Welcome, O' hearty soul, to the communications team! Your task will be difficult,
frustrating, annoying, and ultimately extraordinarily rewarding.  This position
is on-par with the program committee, placing it one rung below the conference
chairs.

As a chair of the communications team, you are the public face of the conference.
However, more importantly, **you are the representative of the community to the
other organizers!** Your job is to advocate for all members of the community,
equally.

Musings
-------
Communication is a two-way street.  It is your job to make sure that both of these
avenues remain open and positive for the entirety of the conference and its
organization.  Often, this requires putting aside your own personal feelings about
an issue.

The conference chairs set the organizational goals overall.  It is your job to see
that these are achieved to the best of your abilities.

In many cases, you will need to step in and act as an official mediator between
organizers, the community and organizers, or other vested parties.  Because of
this you will often be involved in touchy issues.  It is therefore *extremely*
advantageous to be strong friends with the other top brass.  Additionally,
always make it very clear when you are acting as the "Communications Chair" on
behalf of the conference rather than as an individual.  People you don't know will
nominally defer to the conference authority as long as they feel that their
grievances are being heard (your job).  Your friends and fellow organizers will
understand that they are putting you in an uncomfortable situation that they
themselves don't wish to have.  By listening and making your role clear, you
should be able to diffuse and resolve most sensitive topics.

Always act with empathy.

-Website content management (some html knowledge beneficial)
-Graphic design (collateral development, program, t-shirts, banners, signage)
-Outreach (developer mailing lists, meetup groups, individual outreach to speaker prospects, attednees)
-Activities / Social committee (greeters, floaters to ensure introductions are made, people feel included, etc, newcomers )

- One of the chairs needs to be the master of ceremonies (MC) for the conference
  itself.  This involves making sure everything happens on schedule.
- One of the chairs also needs to be in charge of running the lightning talks.
- Determining and scheduling session chairs.  Ideally, the session chairs are
  notable folks from the community.  This is a nice way of honoring people whose
  contributions may otherwise go unrecognized.
- Respond to any emergencies or code of conduct violations

Lightning Talks
---------------
Lightning talks are one of the more democratic parts of the conference as anyone
who wants to can get up and deliver one.  That said, as the organizer of them, it
is your job to make sure that the rules are strictly adhered to!

**Rules:**

- 5 minute talks
- The first to sign up is the first to present
- If you arenâ€™t present when your name is called you will be skipped
- One Talk per Person
- Have fun!

Session Chair Organization
--------------------------
See the mailings directory for a sample invitation email to help round up
sessions chairs.  This should be sent out a week or two prior to the conference
to give everyone a really good idea of whether or not they will actually be able
to make it to the conference.

Point of Contact
-----------------
As the communications chair you are the de facto main point of contact for the
conference (in addition to the conference chairs themselves).  You must be willing to
have your email and cell phone number publicly available during the conference.

In the event of an emergency or the need to moderate a code of conduct violation,
use common sense and prudence.


Within the teams
----------------
To contact all organizers, email to scipy-organizers [AT] scipy [DOT] org.

Weekly phone calls are scheduled with both co-chairs. Anyone is
welcome to join.

Outreach
--------
To inform the outside world about the conference,

* a Scipy conference twitter account has been created. Andy Terrel (andy.terrel
  [AT] gmail.com) is the owner and should be contacted about password.
  username: SciPyConf (For 2015: Courtenay Godshall has information (cgodshall [AT] enthought.com)

* a google+ page ScipyConference has been created and can be reused
  every year:
  https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/100948873231627513165/
  The current owner of the page is jonathanrocher [AT] gmail.com. Others are
  currently managers: cgodshall [AT] enthought.com

* To increase diversity at the conference, there are women coder
  groups that we want to make sure to contact including PyLadies,
  LadyCoders, Women Who Code and CodeChix.  Also be sure to make a friendly post to
  the Python diversity list.


Advertising
------------
Online websites that people read are best places to advertise for the conference:

* scipy.org
* numfocus.org
* python.org
* Enthought.com

Magazine type site are even more effective:
* Slashdot
* Hacker News (don't think they do ads)
* Reddit.com (r/programming or r/python)
* Stacked Overflow (especially http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/ )
* Ars Technica
* Wired
* NA-digest (http://www.netlib.org/na-digest-html/)

You might also try to do organize join-advertizing with other related
conferences:

* PyCon (in all its state and international flavors)
* PyData
* OSCON
* SuperComputing

Not very many developers read journals or magazines, though
occasionally people follow:

* Communications of the ACM
* SIAM News (http://www.siam.org/news/)
