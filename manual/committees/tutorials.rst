Tutorials
==========

Here there are some important points for organizing the tutorials for
the SciPy conference.  They are based on the experience of previous
conferences so please, for the sake of keeping future organizers
happier, you are encouraged update this document in the parts that are
necessary.


Decision points
===============

Tracks
------

  * 2013 had 3 different tracks (introductory, intermediate
    and advanced) with 4 slots of 4 hours each per track.

  * Feedback was positive for this arrangement both years, and we fairly easily filled 60-80 slots per tutorial.

  * More details are in `mailings/tutorials_announcement.rst`

  * 2014 had 4 different tracks (introductory, intermediate, advanced, topics)
    with 4 slots of 4 hours each per track.

  * 2015 had 5 different tracks: 1 full 2 day track for Software Carpentry and 4  tracks (Basics, Statistics and Machine Learning, Performance and Optimization, and Special Topics), which each specified a knowledge level for the individual tutorial as beginner, intermediate, or advanced, with 4 slots of 4 hours each per track. Machine Learning (2 connected tutorials) was so popular we actually had a 6th tutorial track on day 2 to repeat the tutorial from day 1.

Seating
-------

  * Before 2013, we had open seating (i.e. anybody can go to any tutorial).
    In 2013 and 2014, we required people to sign up to attend the tutorial
    they were interested in, and in both years several tutorials were full.

  * In 2013, we had people at the door of full tutorials checking names as
    folks entered. This was effective, but a bit annoying.

  * In 2014, most of the tutorials were either full or close to full. Even
    "full" tutorials had capacity for an extra ~10 people. We did not check
    names at the door, and there were no complaints about lack of seating.

  * In 2015, most tutorials were either full or close to full, even with more tracks. Rooms ranged in size from about 60 to about 95 max and some space was left for volunteers and people to step in.

Introductory Track
------------------

  * There are two approaches to the introductory track: a single, coherent
    curriculum, or a mishmash of multiple intro-level tutorials. In 2013-2014,
    we found we needed to solicit intro tutorials from the community.

  * In 2013, the committee chose specific people from the community and asked
    them to submit intro tutorials. There were more submissions than spaces
    available, and this led to a nice selection of intro topics.

  * In 2014, we make a general solicitation when the proposal due-date was
    extended, and this led to a good selection of intro-level submissions.

  * In the early days of SciPy, there was a single tutorial track which served
    as a broad intro to scientific computing in Python. In years since we've
    moved away from that, but there was some discussion around whether it would
    be good to return to a multiday, coherent tutorial for beginners.

    One idea for this would be to outsource to Software Carpentry, but it's not
    clear that Greg Wilson would support doing this. Another option is to
    specifically solicit intro proposals from a group of 3-4 people who are
    willing to work together and do a 2-day intro track from the ground up.
    With this, the intro track would look a lot more like the original scipy
    conference tutorials.

    In any case, we need to make sure that the intro sections are taught by
    someone who has experience in getting people started from the ground-up:
    i.e. you can't just say "pull this from github" or "run Python from the
    command-line": the students may not know what "github" and the "command
    line" are!

  * In 2015 we did have a Software Carpentry track for 2 days to try to reach out to people who are truly new. This worked pretty well: there were reports of fewer newbies in the lower level tutorials and the SC tutorial went well, but it wasn't very well attended. We think this is still a good idea, but needs to be advertized better and to be possibly broken into 4 hour chunks like the other tutorials instead of keeping people in the track the whole time.
 

Tracks and call for proposals
=============================

It is a pre-condition to have the tracks nailed down before the call
for submissions announcement.  In 2013, 3 different tracks
(introductory, intermediate and advanced) were scheduled, and we
decided to have 4 slots of 4 hours each per track. In 2014, we had four
different tracks (introductory, intermediate, advanced, topical).
More details can be seen in `mailings/tutorials_announcement.rst`

In 2014 and especially 2015, we really chose the tracks based on the submissions we got.

Require that people will have their materials ready a month ahead of time and recommend that they use iPython notebooks to teach with so that the students have the materials to use later and to be able to better follow along.


Introductory Track
------------------

This is one of the most important in terms of bringing new people into
the Scipy community. In 2013, we had to pull the attention of
instructors for most of the tutorial submissions in this category.  We
will need to encourage submissions and/or invite people to teach these
topics. We may want to specify four 1/2 topics and invite proposals
for those specific topics.

Suggested 1/2 day topics in order:

* Introduction Scientific Python Basics (Numpy and IPython)
* Introduction to plotting with Matplotlib
* Software carpentry: git/GitHub, unit testing
* Introduction to data analysis with pandas
* Introduction to Julia (this was presented in 2014, and received quite well)

Intermediate Track
------------------

Prerequisite should be basic understanding of Scipy stack, i.e. numpy,
scipy, matplotlib etc.

Advanced
--------

Under the hood or advanced concepts. 


Preselection
============

* After the last deadline, the tutorial co-chairs should carefully
  study the proposals and, depending on the requirements and 'hot
  topics' for the conference, select the candidates that are best
  suited.  For the selection it is important that you do some research
  about the quality of the tutors as teachers, as this is a critical
  parameter for increasing the quality of the tutorial tracks.

* Get reviewers besides the two tutorials co-chairs to help review. Let everyone know that the reviews will be shared with the submitters. Comments are particularly important in addition to the score values.

* Take notes about the submissions, because these are going to be
  important, specially for providing feedback in non-acceptance mails.
  In 2013 we almost had a 3:1 submission ratio, so better be ready for
  justifying the rejections.  This year we did not provided this, and
  some submitters got very disappointed.

* For doing the preselection, it is important to get in touch with the
  general conference co-chairs, as they have a broader vision of the
  conference, and also past conferences, so they can provide a very nice
  insight on many different aspects of the selection.

* Once the preselection is complete, send a mail to the selected
  tutors and ask for confirmation.  Be patient and wait until
  everybody confirmed.  In 2013 we had a case that took several days
  to confirm.  In this case it helps sending a last call and requiring
  him to confirm in less than 24 hours (this probably helps people
  waiting for company management approval).  He confirmed on-time.

* *Important*: Once the list of tutorials is confirmed and *prior* to
   making it public, *please please please*, send a non-acceptance
   message for non-selected submitters.  In 2013 some folks got angry
   because they found their submissions were not accepted by reading
   the list of accepted tutorials in the official website.  This
   should not happen again (in 2014 we were careful to do this, and included
   specific points on what, if anything, could have made the submission
   stronger).

* *After* the messages for rejection are sent, the list can be made
  public.  Do the proper announcements for this.

* It is important that chairs would not hurry up too much in this stage,
  because the selection is one of the most critical parts of the
  process.  Take your time for this, and our experience is that 2-3
  weeks for tackling the complete selections process would be fine.


Pre-tutorials tasks
===================

* Two months before the conference, send a welcome message to tutors
  with a reminder to define the software requirements as well as
  scripts and exercises ready by two weeks before the tutorials start.
  The reason of having the exercises already defined is to allow
  tutors help each other during the actual tutorials.  You can find an
  example of the welcome message in
  `mailings/tutorials_welcome_tutors.txt`.

* Also, one month before the conference send, and in a separate
  message, send the results of the tutorial surveys for the previous
  year.  They should contain important information for them to prepare
  their material (and for themselves as instructors).

* In 2013 we encouraged tutors to help each other during the
  tutorials.  This turn out to work great, specially on the
  introductory ones, where people tends to have more problems because
  they are not familiar with the environment.  You can find the
  message sent 1 month before the tutorials in
  `mailings/tutorials_help_other_tutors.txt`.

  In 2014, we made this even more explicit and asked in the acceptance email
  if tutors would confirm their willingness to assist in another tutorial.

  In 2015 we tried this again to varying degrees of success. The tutorials with the best help had their own helpers.

* 2 weeks before the tutorials, create a mailing list for all tutors
  (in 2013 it was tutors2013@scipy.org) as well as different mailing
  list for each tutorial.  The general tutorial mailing list will be
  useful not only as a communication channel between organizers and
  tutors but also between them too (for helping each other, for
  example).  The specific mailing lists per each tutorial will serve
  for tutors to communicate with their pupils, and for organizers to
  send the results of the surveys (see below).

  Email lists should work so that as people sign up for tutorials, they are added to the class email list.

* We can make the github repo with a README file part of the application requirements next year, and then we can just automatically check the repos daily for things like check_env.py and some ipython notebooks. Maybe we could even break the stipend up to give peple $200 if they have materials up 10 days prior, and then the rest when they do the tutorial.

* During the 2 week before, send a couple of messages to the tutors
  reminding that they *must* send their instructions to attendees for
  following there tutorials.  It is critical to ensure that tutors do
  not send that information the night before, for example (and despite
  all our efforts this actually happened in 2013).

* Just in case, maybe programming a pre-tutorial install session will
  be a nice safeguard for people not doing a good job reading messages
  from tutors.  But the goal is that nobody would actually need to
  attend to this session (we achieved this in 2013).

* Give suggestions for style in the tutorial: use notebooks to share information and materials with students so they can follow along at their own pace. Encourage instructors not to flip around between too many screens, which can be very distracting and hard to follow. Make sure they plan in breaks which correspond to the times snacks are available. 


Post-tutorial tasks
===================

* Immediately after the tutorials are finished, a survey must be sent
  to the attendees for assessing the performance of the different
  tutors.  You can find the survey for 2013 here:

  http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1291753/SciPy-2013-Testing-Individual-Tutorial-Experience-Feedback

  I don't know if that will survive for next years, so at the end of
  the document there is a text version of it.

  IMPORTANT: There can be tutors attending as pupils to other
  tutorials, so it is *not* enough to send the survey to attendees,
  but you should send it also to *all* tutors too.

* When the results would be ready, send them in a sensible format
  (e.g. text or PDF; never, ever, send a MS Word or other proprietary
  format) to the tutors list.  The results might be useful for next
  year tutors, so please store them in a sensible and *private* place.
  The reason for keeping the results private is that this is somewhat
  sensible info and some tutors may not be happy to see the survey
  results publicly available in a general way.

* After sending the results of the survey, take your time to comment
  the results with tutors on the mailing list and finally send another
  message congratulating all of them for all the effort done.

* And last but not least, take your time to update this manual so that
  other tutorial chairs would find clear instructions for the next
  awesome SciPy conference.


Enjoy organizing the tutorials for the next conference!
