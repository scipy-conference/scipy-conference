Birds of a Feather Sessions
===========================

The idea behind a Birds of a Feather session is to promote community growth
through informal discussion or relaxed panel discussion with substantial
audience participation.  At SciPy, we've had success organizing BoFs to enable
attendees interested in topics and projects to gather for discussion.

Format and Content
------------------

There are two primary formats for BoF sessions.  The first is an informal or
roundtable discussion session.  The second is a moderated panel discussion,
inviting substantial contributions from the audience.  For both of these types
of discussions, however, one or two moderators and organizers are necessary to
ensure that the discussion is both guided and cohesive.  Moderators are
encouraged to either identify participants that will attend (for roundtable or
more informal BoFs and to have an estimate on numbers) or identify panelists in
advance for panelist discussions.

For panelist discussions, moderators should prepare questions in advance, be
prepared to keep the BoF moving along, and enable questions and answers from
the audience.  Successful topics in the past have included broad discussions
of reproducibility, greater inclusion of women in scientific computing, the
advancement of Python within different scientific domains, future directions
for scientific Python, and educational programs in Python.

For informal or roundtable BoFs, having a list of topics beforehand can be
useful, but sometimes moderators have found with a small group, that a simple
poll of the attendees on discussion topics can work. Although, the moderator
should probably have a backup set of topics as well.

Another potential class of topics, which fits into both styles of BoF, is to
hold a "state of the project" BoF.  This can include discussions of future
directions for the project, clearing out of project business (i.e., proposals
for enhancement), advocacy efforts, and general discussion of the project.

The BoF "survival toolkit" for submissions:

   * Suggested participants or panelists
   * Suggested questions for panelists or topics for attendees
   * Moderator
   * Scheduling suggestions
   * Emails for all the suggested panelists, moderators and submitters

Scheduling
----------

At SciPy 2014, BoFs were given multiple time slots during the main three day
conference period.  All rooms were scheduled for BoF's during this time slot,
which was 45 min to 1 hour. This was a very successful scheduling arrangement
because everyone was given the opportunity to attend BoFs without sacrificing
other content.

The BoFs related to mini-symposia at SciPy 2014 were scheduled mostly for
time and rooms adjacent to the mini-symposia themselves.

BoFs scheduling locations were posted on the conference website for easy
access. Most BoFs were arranged before the conference started following the
call for BoFs.

Quick tips to look out for:

   * Try not to schedule too many BoFs of similar topics at the same time
   * Encourage mini-symposia to hold panel discussions during the
     mini-symposium in question
   * Try not to overbook panelists
   * Attempt to solicit BoFs for SciPy core projects
   * Sprintable topics and projects should happen after the main conference
   * Attempt to have the organizer send out an organizing email before hand if
     possible so that potential conflicts that are not obvious can also be
     avoided

Example Emails
--------------

Here are a few solicitation emails.  The first is the solicitation of the Astro
BoF at SciPy 2013::

   Kyle Mandli and I are co-chairing the BoFs this year at SciPy.
   Looking over the Astro mini-symposium schedule, it looks like there's
   no scheduled time for a panel discussion.  What would you think about
   organizing a BoF during one of the scheduled BoF times, and perhaps
   inviting some of the presenters from the astro mini-symposium, people
   who submitted and weren't selected, or other members of the community
   to be on the panel?  If this sounds like a good idea to you, would you
   be willing to moderate the panel?

Although this BoF was well-attended, there was some discussion during the BoF
that it would also have been a good match for a panel during the
mini-symposium, if there had been time.

Here is a soliciation email for a Future of Array Programming BoF::

   We would like to invite you guys for a BoF/panel discussion on your vision
   for the future of AOP at SciPy.

   With multiple projects emerging/having emerged and lots of things on the
   roadmap for NumPy, we thought you guys could bring your vision and
   experience for 5 minutes on how you see the future there and then take
   questions from the audience and a moderator for the rest of the hour.

   Would you be interested in bringing your perspective?

One more:

   Members of the Jupyter Community,

   As one of the co-chairs in charge of organizing the birds-of-a-feather sessions at SciPy this year I wanted to reach out to 
   your community to encourage you to submit a BoF proposal to open up a discussion on topics related to Jupyter development, 
   future or just general questions.  Please let us know if there is anything we can help with in terms of organization.


Posting BoF Information
-----------------------

Since BoFs are one of the more fluid aspects of the conference it is necessary
to able to inform attendees about schedule changes and additional BoFs.  Since
the program cannot be changed once printed, it was confusing to many attendees
to see specific BoFs in the program when they may have been moved around.  In
the future it may be wise get the BoF schedule out early enough so any
corrections can be made before the schedule is printed.

SciPy 2014
++++++++++

The text of the website solicitation::

   SciPy 2014, the thirteenth annual Scientific Computing with Python
   conference, will be held this July 6th-12th in Austin, Texas. SciPy is a
   community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open
   source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The
   annual SciPy Conference allows participants from academic, commercial, and
   governmental organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from
   skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development.

   SciPy has plenty of opportunities to get together and discuss primary,
   tangential, or unrelated topics in an interactive, discussion setting.

   In an effort to increase the opportunities for community building, SciPy
   would like to emphasize the use of birds of a feather (BoFs) sessions.
   These sessions usually include short presentations by a panel and a
   moderator with the bulk of the time spent opening up the discussion to
   everyone in attendance. We will organize a number of BoFs that are of
   general interest such as state-of-the-project and BoFs based on the themes
   of the conference and the mini-symposia topics.

   Some example past BoFs include Reproducibility, Teaching Scientific
   Computing with Python, The Future of Array Oriented Programming, PyNE
   Updates, Python and Finance, NumFOCUS, Python in Astronomy, SciPy 2013,
   Collaborating and Contributing in Open Science, and the Matplotlib
   Enhancement Proposal Discussion.

   We would like to solicit the community for ideas and organizers for other
   BoF topics. Please include a small description of the BoF, possible
   panelists, and whether you would be willing to moderate.

These are the BoFs listed from the SciPy 2013 Website.  Most of these were
held during the main part of the conference, but several were held during the
sprints.

   Reproducibility
     The Royal Society of London's motto is nullius in verba -- on the word of
     no one. Reproducibility is a practiced in science to spread understanding,
     prevent fraud, and ensure empirical results are verifiable. In this
     session, we discuss how to support the practice of reproducible science,
     promote tools that facilitate reproducible experiments, and what
     challenges are particular to Python.

   Teaching scientific computing with Python
     A brainstorming / best practices session for people who have experience in
     teaching scientific computing with Python at undergraduate level, or who
     may take on this challenge in the future!

   The Future of Array Oriented Programming
     With many projects, past and present, extending NumPy and many exciting
     features and improvements planned for upcoming NumPy versions, we plan to
     provide an overview of the current projects, and discuss how people see
     them interacting in the future. We will try to learn from past projects to
     inform the ones in the works right now. We will take questions from the
     audience.

   PyNE Updates
     PyNE is the Nuclear Engineering toolkit. We are currently gearing up for
     some major feature upgrades and the v0.3 release. These include better
     MCNP support, ENDF file handling, the addition of PyTaps-backed meshes,
     transmutation support, and other goodies. Come help us decide what we
     should do next!

   Python and Finance
     Python is increasingly used in finance due to it's excellent support for
     math and science libraries and readable syntax.

   NumFOCUS
     NumFOCUS is a non-profit foundation founded to promote the use of
     accessible and reproducible computing in science and technology. To
     accomplish this mission, it supports the following items:

   Educational Programs
     The promotion of high-level languages, reproducible scientific research,
     and open-code development.  An increase in collaborative research tools
     and documentation.  In this session, we will discuss the mission and
     undertakings of the NumFOCUS foundation. It is a time to ask questions of
     our board members and suggest new or interesting activities for the
     foundation.

   Python in Astronomy
     As a follow-on to the Mini-symposium, we will have a discussion about the
     current status and path forward for Python in astronomy. The goal will be
     to define priorities for focusing effort within the scientist and
     developer community.

   SciPy 2014
     Last year, Lauren Johnson made the great suggestion that we should have a
     BoF for next year's conference. Unfortunately, it wasn't suggested until
     near the end of the conference!  This would be a meeting to discuss plans
     for the 2014 conference. It would also be a great time to recruit new
     folks who are attending the conference that might be interested in helping
     next year.

   Collaborating and Contributing in Open Science
     As evidenced by SciPy 2013, there are many great open science projects.
     The Center for Open Science and the infrastructure being developed (the
     Open Science Framework) seeks to connect these projects and support
     collaboration. We will discuss collaboration possibilities, how developers
     might get involved, and how best to encourage community contribution to
     these efforts.

   Matplotlib enhancement proposal discussion
     A chance to discuss ongoing and new matplotlib enhancement proposals
     (MEPs). MEPs are posted on the matplotlib development wiki here:
     https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/wiki Participants who wish to
     comment or help with existing MEPs or propose entirely new MEPs are
     welcome.

   PySide development planning and sprint kickoff
     A meeting to plan future PySide development and help developers get set up
     for the sprint on Friday and Saturday. Topics will include fixing pyside
     bugs, improving shiboken, and Qt 5 support.  PySide is a Python wrapper
     for the Qt graphic libraries that are used by many desktop applications.
     More information about PySide is at http://www.pyside.org If you are a
     Python developer who uses PySide in your applications and/or a C++
     developer interested in PySide's implementation please plan to attend.

   Women in Scientific Computing: Discussion and Mixer
     Women make up a small (but growing!) number of people doing scientific
     computing. Many reasons have been proposed for why this may be, but many
     questions remain.  Join this mixer and discussion of women in the
     scientific coding community to start a dialogue of ways to address the
     lack of women. Additionally, this will be an informal environment in which
     to build a network of colleagues.

   Data access and munging tools for oceanographic and hydrological applications
     Research and data management communities focused on watery environments
     (oceans, rivers, lakes, climate, etc) rely on a wide range of data
     sources. In addition to the multitude of idiosyncratic data conventions
     and structures that are used, several data encoding and transport
     standards have emerged, but their acceptance varies widely across
     communities. These include netcdf/CF, OPeNDAP, THREDDS catalogs, and OGC
     stack (CSW, WFS, SOS, SensorML, WaterML 2.0, etc), the first generation
     CUAHSI HIS stack (WOF & WaterML 1.x), WQX, and others. Different groups
     have also developed distinct but overlapping libraries to address these
     data access needs. Join us to share the tools you have developed, learn
     about what others are doing, and brainstorm ways to simplify our work and
     bring more coherence to our efforts.

   IPython
     Location is a place holder, will take place somewhere in the sprint rooms.
