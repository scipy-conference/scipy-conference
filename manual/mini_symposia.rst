Mini-symposia
=============

Bioinformatics 
--------------
The bioinformatics symposium focuses on reproducible, integrated and
reusable Python code solving biological problems. The open source
computational biology community faces numerous shared challenges including:

- Producing well-tested, documented, reproducible code within the
  constraints of fast moving research environments.

- Building code and interfaces that can be easily remixed and combined by
  other programmers.

- Developing parallelization and data-reduction methods that handle
  increasingly large data sizes.

- Providing interfaces and visualizations that are intuitive for
  non-computational users while being sufficiently powerful to handle
  the inherently custom needs of researchers.

We welcome abstracts submissions for creative Python solutions to
these problems, especially those that build off existing scientific
code and frameworks.
