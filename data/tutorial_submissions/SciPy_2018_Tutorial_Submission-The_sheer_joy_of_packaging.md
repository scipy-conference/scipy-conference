## Short Description

Building packages in Python used to be hard, especially the ones including compiled extensions. Fortunately, it is getting easier thanks to efforts in the scientific Python community. However, there are still a lot of challenges and complexities facing the package builder.There are at least two major packaging systems (pip/wheel and conda), and lots of different ways to do work with these systems. This tutorial will cover packaging from start to finish for both PyPI and conda, including setup.py, flit, wheels, twine, conda-build, scikit-build, anaconda cloud, and conda-forge. Particular attention will be paid to critical details, such as binary compatibility and platform differences.

- 0:00-00:20 Overview of packaging
	- Source/binary
	- Wheel vs conda packages
	- PyPI/anaconda.org
- 0:20-0:45 setup.py
	- Essential specifications
	- Optional specifications
	- Specifying requirements
		- In setup.py vs requirements file
		- When and how to "pin" requirements
	- Exercise:
		- Fill in the missing pieces in a setup.py for a sample package
		- Build a source distribution for the package
- 0:45-1:00 Building and uploading to PyPI: tools and package types
	- flit: great for simple packages
	- twine: the secure way to upload to PyPI
	- Building a source distribution
	- Building a wheel
		- Multibuild - [https://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild](https://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild)
		- Manylinux docker image - [https://github.com/pypa/manylinux](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux)
		- Delocate - [https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate)
		- Auditwheel - [https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel](https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel)
- 1:00-1:10 Break
- 1:10-1:30 Worked example/exercise: building a package and uploading to pypi
	- Continuing from the the previous exercise, build a wheel for the package
	- Register the package on the pypi testing server
	- Upload the built distributions using twine
	- Delete one of the uploaded files on pypi and try re-uploading (will fail)
	- Introduce the idea of .post releases (it will happen to everyone who uploads)
- 1:30-1:45 Binaries and dependencies: how scikit-build and conda-build can make life easier
- 1:45-2:00 Scikit-build overview:
	- Why + Motivations
	- From [distutils.core.Extension] to [scikit-build + CMake] in few lines
	- Support for developer mode (bonus)
- 2:00-2:45 Exercise: add CMake project that generates python extension. Tie it into previous python project.
	- Cookie cutter template integrating conda, pypi, etc. will be provided.
- 2:45-3:00 Break
- 3:00-3:15 Conda-build overview
- 3:15-3:30 Exercise: write a conda recipe for the sample package from previous exercises (pure python)
	- noarch packages
	- Upload to anaconda cloud
- 3:15-3:45 Exercise: recipe for package with compiled extensions
	- Add compiled extension (source will be provided to students) to sample package
	- Modify recipe, if needed
	- Rebuild the package
	- Version pinning (python, numpy)
	- Split packages - multi-ecosystem ones
	- Compiler packages + pin_downstream
	- Interoperation with scikit-build
- 3:45-4:00 Automated building with cloud-based CI services: conda-forge (optional; as time allows)
	- http://scikit-ci.readthedocs.io
	- http://scikit-ci-addons.readthedocs.io
	- CI service overview & Conda-forge -- what are the pieces and how do they fit together?
		- Recipe format
		- staged-recipes
		- feedstocks
		- Re-rendering and conda-smithy
		- Updating package when new version released
	- Future direction/community needs
	- Invitation to sprints
		- Contributing to Conda-forge
			- Intro to conda-forge: staged-recipes, maintainer role, contributing to an existing package
			- conda-smithy lint/rerender
			- Example to go from the conda-skeleton to a PR on staged-recipes
			- Comment on some special cases: cython extensions, non-python pkgs, the use of the CIs, etc.
		- Exercise: put a package on staged-recipes

###  Tutorial code base layout:

- Name of the organization: [python-packaging-tutorial](https://github.com/python-packaging-tutorial)
- All projects should be associated with a `cookiecutter` template
- One organization with multiple repos (or multiple branches ?)
	- `0_readme`
	- `1_helloworld_pure`
		- Install python
		- Work with virtual env
		- Include pytest, documentation building, ...
	- `2_helloworld_c`
		- Show how C extensions are included in setup.py, and how they are made available to python
	- `3_helloworld_with_ci`
		- Introduce Appveyor, CircleCi, Travis
		- Difference between CI for testing and CI for creating packages (CD) 
	- `4_helloworld_skbuild`
		- Introduce C extensions with cmake
		- Show how scikitbuild can help tie python and cmake together nicely
	- `5_helloworld_skbuild_ci`
		- Show how scikitbuild-ci can be used to simplify and unify CI scripts 
	- `6_helloworld_skbuild_conda`
		- Show how conda-build can be used to produce conda packages and wheels, using the build files we’ve already used from previous exercises.
	- `7_Uploading_to_PyPI_&_anaconda.org`

## Setup Instructions

On Windows install Visual C++ Build Tools 2015: [http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools) 

On macOSX, install Xcode: [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).

On Linux, we’ll have compiler packages provided via conda. Participants should have Docker installed and working to experiment with the dockcross and manylinux docker images. 

Any python 3.5+ installation will be fine. Michael will provide conda-based installers for all platforms that cover everything but the compiler. 

We will have a small sample package that folks can build to make sure that their compiler, etc setup is working. 

Participants should set up an account on PyPI (https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=register_form) and on anaconda.org (https://anaconda.org/) prior to attending the tutorial.
