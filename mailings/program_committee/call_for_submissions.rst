SciPy 2013 Call for Submissions
-------------------------------

SciPy 2013, the twelfth annual Scientific Computing with Python conference, will
be held this June 24th-29th in Austin, Texas. SciPy is a community dedicated to
the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for
mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows
participants from academic, commercial, and governmental organizations to showcase 
their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on
code development.

The deadline for abstract submissions is *March 18th, 2013*.  Submissions are
welcome that address general scientific computing with Python, or one of the two
special themes for this years conference, or the domain-specific mini-symposia
held during the conference.  Examples talks from previous years are available
online[1].

Themes
------

Two specialized tracks run in parallel to general conference:

- Machine learning
- Reproducible science

Mini-symposia on the following topics are also being organized:

- Medical imaging
- Meteorology, climatology, and atmospheric and oceanic science
- Astronomy and astrophysics
- Bioinformatics

Abstracts submission
--------------------

The 150-300 word abstract should concisely describe software of interest to the
SciPy community, tools or techniques for more effective computing, or how
scientific Python was applied to solve a research problem.  A traditional
background/motivation, methods, results, and conclusion structure is encouraged
but not required.  Links to project websites, source code repositories, figures,
and evidence of public speaking ability are encouraged.

Each abstract will be peer-reviewed by multiple members of the Program Committee
Board.  Please submit your abstract at the SciPy 2013 website[2] (submission
form forthcoming).  Abstracts will be accepted for posters or presentations.
Optional papers to be published in the conference proceedings will be requested
following abstract submission.

We look forward to an exciting and interesting set of talks, posters, and
discussions and hope to see you at the conference.
