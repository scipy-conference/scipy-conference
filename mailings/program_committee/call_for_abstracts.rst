SciPy 2013 Call for Conference Abstracts
----------------------------------------

SciPy 2013, the twelfth annual Scientific Computing with Python conference, will
be held this June 24th-29th in Austin, Texas. SciPy is a community dedicated to
the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for
mathematics, science, and engineering.

The deadline for abstract submissions is *March 18th, 2013*.  Submissions are
welcome that address general scientific computing with Python, or one of the two
special themes for this years conference, or the domain-specific mini-symposia
held during the conference.


Themes
------

Two specialized tracks run in parallel to general conference:

- Machine learning
- Tools for reproducibility

Mini-symposia on the following topics are also being organized:

- Medical imaging
- Meteorology, climatology, and atmospheric and oceanic science
- Astronomy and astrophysics
- Bioinformatics

Abstracts submission
--------------------

Each abstract will be peer-reviewed by multiple members of the Program Committee
Board.  Please submit your abstract to the `SciPy 2013 Abstract Submission Site
<http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013/submissions>`_, which will come online in
the coming weeks.  Abstracts will be accepted for posters or presentations.
Optional papers to be published in the conference proceedings will be requested
following abstract submission.

The 150-300 word abstract should concisely describe software of interest to the
SciPy community or how scientific Python was applied to solve a research
problem.  A traditional background/motivation, methods, results, and conclusion
structure is encouraged but not required.  Links to project websites, source
code repositories, figures, and evidence of public speaking ability are highly
encouraged.
