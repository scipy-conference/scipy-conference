SciPy 2013 will continue the tradition of offering sponsorships to attend the
conference.  These sponsorships provide funding for airfare, lodging, and
conference registration.  Unlike in previous years, these sponsorships will be
offered to all attendees rather than just students.


This year, applications will be judged both on merit as well as need.  Although
sponsorships are open to all attendees, we encourage applicants to consider
their level of need before applying, such as whether your institution is
covering some or all of your travel costs.  As funds are limited, our goal is
to bring together as many SciPy community members as possible.  If you only
require partial sponsorship, please indicate this in your application and we
may be able to accommodate additional applicants due to such reasonable
requests.


The application form can be found on the web at
http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013/reg_fin_aid.php


If you would like to apply for yourself or a worthy candidate, please note our
application due date of Sunday, March 20th.  Winners will be announced on April
22nd.


Good luck!


The SciPy 2013 Team
