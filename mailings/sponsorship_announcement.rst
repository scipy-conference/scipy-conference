SciPy 2014 will continue the tradition of offering sponsorships to attend the
conference.  These sponsorships can provide funding for airfare, lodging, and
conference registration.  Like last year, these sponsorships will be open to
community members and students.


Applications will be judged both on merit as well as need.  Although all
attendees are eligible for sponsorships, we encourage applicants to consider
their level of need before applying, such as whether their institution is
covering some or all of their travel costs.  As funds are limited, our goal is
to bring together as many SciPy community members as possible.  If only partial
sponsorship is required, please indicate this in the application and we
may be able to accommodate additional applicants due to such reasonable
requests.


The application form can be found on the web at
http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/reg_fin_aid.php


If you would like to apply for yourself or a worthy candidate, please note our
application due date of Monday, April 7th.  Winners will be announced on May
5th.


Good luck!


The SciPy 2014 Team
