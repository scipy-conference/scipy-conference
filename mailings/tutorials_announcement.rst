SciPy 2013 Tutorials - Call for Submissions
-------------------------------------------

SciPy 2013, the twelfth annual Scientific Computing with Python conference, will
be held this June 24th-29th in Austin, Texas. SciPy is a community dedicated to
the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for
mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows
participants from academic, commercial, and governmental organizations to showcase 
their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on
code development.

The conference always kicks off with two days of tutorials. These sessions provide
extremely affordable access to expert training, and consistently receive fantastic 
feedback from participants. This year we are expanding the tutorial session to 
include three parallel tracks: introductory, intermediate and advanced.

The new introductory track specifically targets programmers with no prior knowledge 
of scientific python and to ensure a consistent overall experience, the topics for
these sessions have been fixed. 

**We are now accepting tutorial proposals from individuals or teams that would like 
to teach a tutorial at SciPy 2013**

Whether you are a major contributor to a scientific Python library or an 
expert-level user, this is a great opportunity to share your knowledge and offset 
some of the costs of your SciPy 2013 attendance.

Topics
------

Tutorials should be focused on covering a well-defined topic in a hands-on manner. 
We want to see attendees coding! We encourage submissions to be designed to allow 
at least 50% of the time for hands-on excerises even if this means the subject 
matter needs to be limited. Tutorials will be 4 hours in duration and will be 
assigned to one of the three tracks.

For examples of content and format, you can refer to past tutorials from past SciPy 
tutorial sessions ([SciPy2012][1], [SciPy2011][2], [SciPy2010][3]). We are looking 
for awesome techniques or packages, helping new or advanced python programmers 
develop better or faster scientific applications. 

Submissions to the intermediate and advanced track are open to all topics but 
for submissions to the introductory track, please choose from one of the 4 topics 
listed below: 

* Introduction Scientific Python Basics (Numpy and IPython)
* Introduction to plotting with Matplotlib
* Introduction to Scipy: optimization, linear algebra, statistics, and more
* Introduction the data analysis with Pandas


Stipend
-------

In recognition of the effort required to plan and prepare a high quality tutorial, 
we give at least a $750 stipend to each instructor (or team of instructors) for 
each half-day session they lead. This may stipend may increase to $1000 depending 
on availability of funds.

Proposal Submission
-------------------

To submit your tutorial proposal, please send the following materials to tutorials@scipy.org:

* A short bio of the presenter or team members, containing a description of past 
experiences as a trainer/teacher/speaker, and (ideally) links to videos of these 
experiences if available.
* Which track the tutorial would fit best in Intermediate or Advanced if an open 
submisssion, or which of the 4 introductory topics otherwise
* A (~15 lines) description of the tutorial, suitable for posting on the SciPy 
website for attendees to view. It should include the target audience, the 
expected level of knowledge prior to the class, and the goals of the class. 
* A more detailed outline of the tutorial content, including the duration of each 
part, and exercise sessions for the review process. Please include a description 
of how you plan to make the tutorial hands-on.
* A list of Python packages that attendees will need to have installed prior 
to the class to follow along. Please mention if any packages are not cross platform. 
Installation instructions or links to installation documentation should be provided 
for packages that are not available through easy_install, pip, EPD, Anaconda CE etc., 
or that require third party or compiled libraries. 
* If available, the tutorial notes, slides, exercise files, ipython notebooks, that 
you already have, even if they are preliminary.

Selection
---------

Accepted tutorials will be announced on April 15th. Final tutorial materials and 
instructions for attendees will be due on June 24th. This will include final version 
numbers of required software to ensure that attendees have sufficient time to prepare
before the conference.
