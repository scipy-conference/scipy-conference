SciPy John Hunter Excellence in Plotting Contest
================================================

In memory of John Hunter, we are pleased to announce the first SciPy
John Hunter Excellence in Plotting Competition.  This open competition
aims to highlight the importance of quality plotting to scientific
progress and showcase the capabilities of the current generation of
plotting software.  Participants are invited to submit scientific
plots to be judged by a panel.  The winning entries will be announced
and displayed at the conference.

NumFOCUS is graciously sponsoring cash prizes for the winners in the
following amounts:

* 1st prize: $500
* 2nd prize: $200
* 3rd prize: $100

Instructions
------------

* Entries must be submitted by March 20 via e-mail to
  plotting-contest@scipy.org

* Plots may be produced with any combination of Python-based tools (it
  is not required that they use matplotlib, for example).

* Source code for the plot must be provided, along with a rendering of
  the plot in a vector format (PDF, PS, etc.).  If the data can not be
  shared for reasons of size or licensing, "fake" data may be
  substituted, along with an image of the plot using real data.

* Entries will be judged on their clarity, innovation and aesthetics,
  but most importantly for their effectiveness in illuminating real
  scientific work.  Entrants are encouraged to submit plots that were
  used during the course of research, rather than merely being
  hypothetical.

* Scipy reserves the right to display the entry at the conference, use
  in any materials or on its website, providing attribution to the
  original author(s).

Important dates:
