Randal's Drawing, SciPy 2014
============================

Attached is a scan of "Randal's" SciPy sketch.

As many of you were there, you know the story, but here it is again:

While at the BBQ after the first day of sprints, I was approached by a local street artist asking: "What is this Scipy thing?".

I told him that Python was a computer programming language, and this was a group of folks using it to do science. Essentially the intersection of scientists and computer geeks. He responded with "real eggheads, huh?"

15 minutes later, he returned and gave me the enclosed sketch.

I really like how he captured: "the *chosen* language"

We took up a collection and were able to give him a very generous donation for his efforts.

Not sure what to do with it now, but perhaps we might use it in promotional materials or something in the future.

Great conference as usual !

PS: I'm not really sure how to get this out there, so I thought I'd start here. I suppose I should get a blog up on gitHub some day...
